Welcome to the Fundraiser decentralized application (dApp) on the Avalanche Network! This dApp allows users to create and participate in fundraising campaigns on the Avalanche Network.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Fundraiser dApp, you will need to have an Avalanche wallet with AVAX tokens. You can create a wallet at [wallet.avax.network](https://wallet.avax.network/) and purchase AVAX on [avalanche.exchange](https://avalanche.exchange/).

Once you have your Avalanche wallet set up and funded with AVAX, you can access the Fundraiser dApp at [fundraiser.avax.network](https://fundraiser.avax.network/).

## Creating a Campaign

To create a campaign, you will need to provide a campaign name, goal amount, and deadline. You will also need to specify a smart contract address that will receive the funds raised by the campaign.

Once the campaign is created, other users can participate by sending AVAX to the campaign's smart contract address.

## Participating in a Campaign

To participate in a campaign, you can simply send AVAX to the campaign's smart contract address. You can find the smart contract address on the campaign page on the Fundraiser dApp.

Please note that the campaign will only be successful if the goal amount is reached by the deadline. If the goal is not reached, all funds will be returned to the participants.

## Viewing Campaign Progress

You can view the progress of a campaign by visiting the campaign page on the Fundraiser dApp. The page will display the total amount raised, the goal amount, and the deadline.

## Withdrawing Funds

Once a campaign is successful and the goal is reached, the campaign creator can withdraw the funds to the specified smart contract address. The campaign creator can also withdraw the funds at any time if the campaign is unsuccessful.

## Disclaimer

Please be aware that participating in a campaign is at your own risk. The Fundraiser dApp and the Avalanche Network are not responsible for any loss of funds. Make sure to carefully review the smart contract code and the campaign details before participating.
